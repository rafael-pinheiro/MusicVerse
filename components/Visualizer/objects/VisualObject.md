VisualObjects
-----

Resonsible for the objects and how they are rendered.
Should not contain [behaviour](../behaviours/Behaviour.md) logic, only visual representation and possibly physics in the future.


VisualObjectsGroup
-----
Sometimes you want to control a group of objects at the same time. This is a wrapper around VisualObjects to help with that.
